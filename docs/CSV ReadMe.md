**CSV File Format**

The format of a CSV file should have one word or phrase on every line followed by the values of that word.

For a single word, it should be input in the following format:

The word itself, a number that represents how secure that word is, and then whether or not the word contains numbers that make it more secure based on the numbers.

An example of a single word is the word 'Rowan' with the secure value of .4 and no important numbers following it. So we would enter this into the file as shown below.

Rowan, .4, 0

If there was another word after that, we would input it like this,

Rowan, .4, 0
University, .8, 0

An example of a word with extra secureness based on numbers, would be '1000Rocks' with the secure value of .7 and this time there are secure numbers after it. This would be shown like this:

1000Rocks, .7, 1

You will notice that there is a 1 for the last value now. This is because it used secure numbers. If we have all of these words in the file, it would look like this:

Rowan, .4, 0
University, .8, 0
Rocks138, .7, 1

For a phrase, it's the same thing except there is a place for the number of words in the format. You type the number of words right after the phrase itself. So for the phrase 'Eagles are awesome' it would be input as follows:

Eagles are awesome, 5, .8, 0

This phrase had 5 words, a secureness of .8, and no secure numbers added to it.

The phrase '2 heads are better than 1' with a secureness of .2, and the numbers are important, it would look like this:

2 heads are better than 1, 4, .2, 1





If we added everything in one file, it could look like this:

Rowan, .4, 0
University, .8, 0
2 heads are better than 1, 4, .2, 1
Rocks138, .7, 1
Eagles are better than tigers, 5, .8, 0



**Restrictions**

No commas allowed in words that are input. For obvious reasons, this will make the file be interpreted in the wrong way and will not work correctly.
Make sure there are no commas at the end of the lines in each entry.
